# BadSpaceGame
This is a space game I tried making when I first began learning Java.

My intention was to create a 2D space game featuring dynamic movement and basic shooting mechanics, sort of like Star Fox 64.
It is painfully obvious that my ambitions greatly exceeded my skill level at the time. However, I hope to rework this project in the future to create the 
game that I first imagined!

Feel free to check out the program in its current state by downloading and running the source code in your preferred IDE.

But be warned, <b>WHAT FOLLOWS WILL NOT BE PRETTY</b>.
